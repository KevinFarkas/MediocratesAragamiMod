**How to use my mod with Aragami 2**

Step 1:  Extract BepInEx into the root folder for Aragami 2: "..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aragami 2".  Hereâ€™s the one for Windows.
https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be/738/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-be.738%2Baf0cba7.zip

Step 2: Launch the game once and close it.  This will make sure BepInEx configs are created.  Make sure this folder exists now "..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aragami 2\BepInEx\config";

Step 3: Extract my mod into the "..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aragami 2\BepInEx\plugins" folder.  The folder structure should be "..\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Aragami 2\BepInEx\plugins\MediocratesAragamiMod.  In this folder you should have MediocratesAragamiMod.dll and MediocratesAragamiMod.pdb

Step 4: Run the game.
